# BMP Image Tutorial

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to read and write BMP image files in C++ using a custom image class.  
It implements basic functionality for exporting and importing uncompressed 24-bit BMP images.

## Features
- Custom `Image` class representing BMP file data  
- Writing a bitmap file with procedural pixel data  
- Reading existing BMP files into memory via `Image`  
- Example usage via `BmpTutorial.cpp`

## Status
### Completed
- BMP file export with configurable dimensions and pixel data  
- BMP file parsing and in-memory representation via `Image`  
![image](image.bmp)

### Not Yet Implemented
- Image manipulation tools (filters, transformations, etc.)  
- Support for additional BMP formats (e.g. with alpha, compression)  
- Unit tests

## Build & Run
Requirements:  
- C++17 compatible compiler
